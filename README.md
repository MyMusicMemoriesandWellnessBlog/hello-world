Hi, and welcome to my site! I have always loved music: singing, playing, reading (and relating to) lyrics; and I have played piano since age 9. Thereâ€™s always been music playing either in the background or at the center of my attention. I was even a member of a rock band.

The connection already exists between Music and Wellness. People have been using music therapy with exercise, for instance. Music can help to relieve a myriad of symptoms. It can be a part of anyoneâ€™s plan of attack fighting diseases, or coming back from other health issues. In my case, I had a stroke a year ago.

There were many aspects to my recovery. Part of it was physical. I had a couple months of personal physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. But part of recovery is the mental aspect. There were things that I could not remember, there were things that I had to relearn, and there were things that I just had to figure out again. I found that music was a great source for me to do that. Singing the songs helps memory. I can use the lyrics to remember words. I would read the lyrics so I could look at how theyâ€™re spelled.
I hope you can find something that helps you here~alwaysdonnalee ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¶ðŸ’œ
